Repository to test the capabilities of GitHub action and how to manage them at scale.

# Secrets

##Â default GITHUB_TOKEN

An ephemeral GITHUB_TOKEN is is passed to the workflows if none is defined,
it makes easy to access to GitHub repository, 
however you must define the permissions of that GITHUB_TOKEN explicitly
to avoid surprises. By dafault it has only content read permission.
